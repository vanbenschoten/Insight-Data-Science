#Introduction

This repository contains (cleaned) example code from the data analysis I performed as a part of the Insight Data Science fellowship in June 2015. Because I worked in conjunction with a start-up, I am unable to provide the actual code/data I worked with due to confidentiality. However, you can read about my findings at fantasyfootballsabermetrics.com/insight.

This code also does not contain any of my specific PostgreSQL queries, but examples of some MySQL work I've done can be found in the sabermetrics/espn_scraping.py repository path.

Thanks for reading!
